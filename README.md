# Chemical Seesaw ⚖️  
An interactive web-based game that helps students learn how to balance chemical equations using a **seesaw analogy**. This game makes the concept of balancing equations more **visual, intuitive, and engaging**!  

## 🔬 Features  
- 🏋️ **Seesaw Representation**: Visualizes chemical balancing as a seesaw to demonstrate equation equilibrium.  
- 🎯 **Interactive Coefficient Adjustment**: Users can modify coefficients to balance the equation.  
- 💡 **Instant Feedback**: Provides hints when equations are unbalanced.
